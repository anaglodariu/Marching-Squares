# Marching-Squares
Turning the sequential implementation of the Marching Squares Algorithm into a parallel one

# Overview
In computer graphics, marching squares is an algorithm that generates contours for a two-dimensional scalar field.
We already have the sequential implementation of a program that generates contours for topological maps using the Marching Squares algorithm. 
This must be parallelized so we obtain the same output files as the sequential version, but with improved execution times.
